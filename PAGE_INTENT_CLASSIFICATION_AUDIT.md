# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
All page tiers have been audited and optimized. The site now features a cohesive conversion strategy with consistent CTAs, trust signals to reduce friction, and appropriate metadata for SEO visibility.

**KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:**
1.  **Tier 1 (High-Intent):** Added missing metadata to /website-widget and trust signals to /contact. Standardized "Schedule Your Walkthrough" CTA with microcopy across all product pages.
2.  **Tier 2 (Nurture):** Added high-impact `FinalCTA` components to all support/nurture pages (/team, /trust, /faqs, /integrations, /resources), eliminating conversion dead-ends.
3.  **Content Gap:** Created and published high-value "Bottom-of-Funnel" content ("The 9 PM Problem") and streamlined the Resources hub.
4.  **Technical SEO:** Validated Sitemap and Robots.txt to ensure all new paths are indexable.
5.  **Mobile Polish:** Optimized CTA spacing for small screens (iPhone/Mobile).

# NOTES FOR FUTURE ITERATION
*   **Blog Dynamic CTAs:** Considerations for future "Level 2" work: Implementing logic to swap CTA types based on blog category (e.g., Newsletter for ToFu vs. Demo for BoFu).
*   **A/B Testing:** Monitor conversion rates on the new "Schedule Your Walkthrough" verbiage vs. "Book Demo".

**PROJECT CLOSED.**
