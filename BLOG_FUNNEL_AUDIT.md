## 3. Gaps & Opportunities

1.  **Case Study Content:** While there are strict "Case Study" pages, the blog lacks narrative success stories (e.g., "How Dealer X added $50k/mo").
2.  **BoFu content is thin:** Only 2 articles focus on the hard decision/ROI metrics.
3.  **CTA Mismatches:** Ensure ToFu posts don't aggressively push for a Demo. Use "Soft Conversions" (Newsletter, Calculator) for ToFu, and "Hard Conversions" (Demo, Pilot) for BoFu.

---

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Add 2-3 BoFu Articles:** Focus on "VisQuanta vs Competitors" or "The Cost of Inaction".
2.  **Implement Dynamic CTAs:**
    *   ToFu posts -> Sticky Footer Bar for Newsletter.
    *   MoFu posts -> Mid-content "Related Resource" box.
    *   BoFu posts -> Persistent "Book Demo" button in sidebar/header.
3.  **Create "Success Story" Blog Category:** Bridge the gap between formal case studies and casual reading.
