## Company Overview

VisQuanta is an AI service provider exclusively serving the automotive retail industry in the United States. The company was founded to address critical operational challenges that cost dealerships millions in lost revenue annually.

### The Problem VisQuanta Solves

Modern car dealerships face interconnected challenges:

1. **CRM Lead Decay**: 84% of CRM leads are never re-engaged after 30 days, leaving millions in latent revenue untapped.
2. **Missed Service Calls**: 1 in 4 service department calls are missed or go to voicemail, directly losing $340+ per missed repair order.
3. **BDC Turnover**: 45% average annual staff churn rate means constant retraining and lost consistency.
4. **Slow Lead Response**: Average weekend response time is 22 minutes—competitors close deals in under 5 minutes.

### The VisQuanta Solution

AutoMaster Suite is a unified AI platform that automates lead engagement, appointment booking, review management, and service coordination without adding headcount.

## Product 1: Lead Reactivation (LLM - Lead Loss Mitigation)

2. Personalized SMS conversations engage each lead based on their original interest
3. AI qualifies intent and handles objections conversationally
4. Hot leads are handed off to sales team with appointment booked

### Key Differentiators

- Conversational AI, not blast messaging
- Works 24/7 including nights and weekends
- Compliance-first approach with proper opt-out handling
- No new leads required—monetizes existing CRM data

### Performance

3. Conversational AI qualifies the lead and answers questions
4. Appointment booked and handed to sales team

### Why Speed Matters

## Product 3: Website Widget (SMS-First Chat)

The Website Widget converts website visitors into captured leads by transitioning from web chat to SMS.

### How It Works

1. Visitor engages with chat widget on dealership website
2. AI captures visitor's real cell phone number early in conversation
3. Conversation continues via SMS, persisting beyond browser session
4. Lead is qualified and appointment booked

### Why SMS-First Matters

Traditional webchat is where leads go to die:
- Visitors leave the page and conversation is lost
- No persistent contact method captured
- Low engagement after initial interaction

SMS-first approach solves this:
- 98% SMS open rate vs. ~20% email
- Conversation continues after visitor leaves site
- Real phone number captured for ongoing engagement

### Performance
