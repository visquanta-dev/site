## The Problem VisQuanta Solves

### Lead Reactivation Gap
84% of CRM leads are never re-engaged after 30 days. The average dealership has thousands of leads that showed interest, received a few follow-ups, then were forgotten. These aren't cold leads—they're people who already raised their hand. VisQuanta's AI systematically works through this backlog, reactivating dormant leads into booked appointments.

### Speed to Lead Crisis
Research shows responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you 21x more likely to qualify them compared to 30 minutes. Yet most dealerships average 45+ minutes for first response—and that's during business hours. After hours, leads wait until morning. Every minute of delay costs conversions.

### BDC Turnover & Inconsistency
BDC teams face 30-40% annual turnover. Training is constant. Follow-up quality varies by rep. After-hours coverage is expensive or non-existent. Dealers are caught between hiring more staff (expensive, inconsistent) or losing leads (also expensive).

### Service Department Overwhelm
Service advisors are drowning. Every unanswered call is a missed RO. The average dealership loses $8,500/week in service revenue from missed calls alone. Customers expect instant scheduling, but advisors are juggling walk-ins, phone calls, and technician coordination simultaneously.

## AutoMaster Suite - Product Overview

AutoMaster Suite is VisQuanta's flagship automotive AI platform. It's not a single feature—it's five integrated capabilities that work together to capture, convert, and retain dealership customers.

### 1. Lead Reactivation (LLM)

**What it does:** AI-powered conversational outreach to dormant CRM leads. The system analyzes your CRM, identifies leads that went cold, and initiates personalized text conversations to re-engage them.

**How it works:**
1. Integrates directly with your CRM (VinSolutions, DealerSocket, eLead, etc.)
2. Identifies leads with no activity in 30+ days
3. Sends personalized SMS outreach based on original interest
4. Engages in natural conversation to qualify and book appointments
5. Syncs all activity back to CRM in real-time

**Results:**
- 30%+ re-engagement rate on dormant leads
- 11% average lift in vehicles sold
- Typical dealership sees 50+ additional appointments/month from existing CRM data

**Why it matters:** You've already paid to acquire these leads. Lead reactivation extracts value from sunk marketing costs.

### 2. Speed to Lead

**What it does:** Instant AI response to all inbound leads—web forms, third-party leads, OEM leads—within 60 seconds, 24/7/365.

**How it works:**
1. Lead arrives from any source (website, Cars.com, CarGurus, OEM, etc.)
2. AI responds via SMS within 60 seconds
3. Engages in qualifying conversation
4. Books appointment or hands off to sales team
5. All conversations logged to CRM

**Results:**
- 21x higher conversion vs 30-minute response
- <60 second average response time
- 24/7 coverage including nights, weekends, holidays

**Why it matters:** The dealer who responds first usually wins. Speed to lead ensures you're always first.

### 3. Website Widget

**What it does:** SMS-first web chat that captures real phone numbers and continues conversations after visitors leave the site.

**How it works:**
1. Visitor engages with chat widget on dealer website
2. Widget requests phone number to continue via text
3. Conversation continues via SMS (98% open rate vs 20% email)
4. AI qualifies and books appointments
5. Leads captured even if visitor bounces

**Results:**
- 3x more leads captured vs traditional web chat
- 98% message open rate
- Conversations persist beyond browser session

**Why it matters:** Traditional chat dies when the visitor leaves. SMS-first means the conversation continues.

### 4. Reputation Management (ARM)

**What it does:** Automated review generation that detects satisfied customers and intercepts negative feedback before it goes public.

**How it works:**
1. System detects completed sales and positive service interactions
2. Sends review request to happy customers
3. Routes negative feedback to management for resolution
4. Monitors Google, Facebook, Yelp for new reviews
5. Alerts team to respond to reviews promptly

**Results:**
- 100% review response rate
- 4.8+ average star rating for active users
- Negative feedback intercepted before public posting

**Why it matters:** 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Reputation directly impacts floor traffic.

### 5. Service Drive AI

**What it does:** Voice AI that answers inbound service calls, books appointments, handles recall reminders, and manages routine inquiries—with zero missed calls.

**How it works:**
1. AI answers service line (or overflow/after-hours)
2. Understands customer intent via natural conversation
3. Books appointments directly into scheduler
4. Handles recall notifications, maintenance reminders
5. Escalates complex issues to human advisors

**Results:**
- 98% call answer rate (vs 60-70% industry average)
- 0 missed calls during business hours
- 24/7 service scheduling availability

**Why it matters:** Every missed service call is a missed RO. Service Drive AI ensures every call becomes an opportunity.
