## GLOBAL CRO FINDINGS (ALL PAGES)

### 1. THE "CTA DRIFT" PROBLEM
Across 30+ pages, the primary action button text changes significantly:
- "Schedule Your Walkthrough" (Standard)
- "Activate Your Revenue Engine" (Suite Hub)
- "Secure Your Territory" (Dealers Hub)
- "Unlock My Found Money" (Pre-Owned)
- "Start Revenue Audit" (Lead Reactivation)
- "Schedule Your 15-Min Strategy Call" (Booking Page)

**IMPACT:** Cognitive load. Users have to "re-learn" what the orange button does on every page.

### 2. THE "TRUST GAP"
We claim "500+ Dealerships" on some pages and "200+" or "50+" on others.
**IMPACT:** Loss of credibility if a user notices the discrepancy while browsing.

### 3. THE "RESPONSE TIME" MISMATCH
Claims vary between "Under 60s" and "Under 90s".
**IMPACT:** Undermines the primary value proposition (speed).

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**PAGES AUDITED:** 33 pages identified, 15+ analyzed in depth.

---

### TOP 5 HIGHEST-IMPACT ISSUES

1. ~~**Inconsistent CTA text**~~ - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Standardized to "Schedule Your Walkthrough"
2. **Primary hero CTA uses ghost style** - Homepage - Medium - Reduced visual prominence
3. **Inconsistent response time claims (60s vs 90s)** - Multiple pages - Medium - Undermines credibility
4. **No secondary CTA in Final CTA section** - Global component - Medium - No soft conversion path
5. **Trust stat "500+" not linked to proof** - Homepage - Low - Missed trust-building opportunity

---

### QUICK WINS (Low effort, high impact)

1. **Standardize all primary CTAs to "Schedule Your Walkthrough"** - Copy-only change across pages (DONE)
2. **Change hero CTA from ghost to solid orange fill** - Single CSS class change
3. **Add link from "500+ Dealerships" to case studies page** - Single link addition

---

### STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Higher effort, high impact)

1. **Create CTA messaging framework document** - Ensure all future pages use consistent language
2. **Audit and standardize all numerical claims (response time, dealer count)** - Data verification needed
3. **Add secondary "softer" conversion paths** - "Explore case studies" links for consideration-stage visitors

## AWAITING APPROVAL

The primary standardization is done. Future recommendations require owner approval.
